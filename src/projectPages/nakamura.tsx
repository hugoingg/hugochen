          This was my first internship project with a health service company,
          Nakamura Holistic Therapy. It was a 4 months long, hybrid internship,
          though most of my workings was done remotely. My job was to redesign
          the business's landing website to have a more sophisticated UI and UX.
          I was tasked to use Figma, and in particular, the Web-To-Figma
          extension for me to take inspirations from existing modern websites.
          Throughout my time, I drew inspirations from websites of big companies
          such as Anaconda, Samsung, Iphone, Adobe, etc. I also made the
          graphics used on the design, using Canva, MediBang Paint, and by
          freely importing from the internet.

            By the time I finished my internship, the designing tasks delegated
            to me was fully finished on Figma, but those on my peer's end was
            not. Thus, unfortunately, my design has not been implemented to the
            existing website. For that reason as well, I may not post pictures
            showing the new design in this blog yet. I do have the offer to get
            back on to this project, while it is unfinished. I plan to do so as
            I am aware this website has a huge traffic and it is a significant
            aspect of the company. Therefore, I wish to learn first-hand how
            major changes can be applied without causing drawbacks during the
            possible down time.
