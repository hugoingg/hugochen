          This blog was the 4th website I worked on, and the only one I did by
          myself. The other 3 websites were team works, one done by using
          Wordpress, one used Google Sites, and the other one used React
          framework, which I also used for this blog, along with HTML, CSS,
          Vite, and Typescript. Unlike other projects that I have done, I did
          not obtain the base knowledge for this blog website professionally.
          Instead, I learned it by myself, through the team work that I did on a
          previous website and online tutorials.

            I begun working on this blog by imagining how the layout would look
            like, and what are the informations that I would display. Many of
            the features on my blog was inspired from my seniors', one of which
            was the stacks logo that I worked with, as I realized this was
            important to concisely and quickly tell what tools I am familiar
            working with. Another thing was the narration, which was also
            important to keep the blog entertainning to explore as well as
            informative. Once I got the overall image of how my blog would look
            like, I began working on the React routing and the navigation bar.
            From there, I built on each pages, and add new ones as neccessary.

            I have yet to call this blog "finished". This is because I will be
            updating the content as I do more projects or gain more experiences.
            I really enjoyed my workflow for this blog as I feel like it is very
            stress-free, in a sense that I can just make and decorate elements
            without worrying for major errors.
