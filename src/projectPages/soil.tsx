          This was a Design Thinking Project, an assignment by SUTD. I did this
          project in a group of 4 people. We aim to create a linear regression
          AI model to predict the amount of Carbon emission produced due rice
          cultivation in Thailand. We started by collecting data from the
          internet that can be our features and targets to train the model.
          Afterwards, we clean the data of unnecessary columns, and checked the
          linearity of each features against the target. We initially used 4
          features: rice yield in a year, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium
          fertilizers used, and 1 target: the amount of Carbon emission due rice
          cultivation.
